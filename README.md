# RISCV_PipelineCore

## Project Overview
RISC-V is an independent project focused on designing and implementing a basic pipeline processor based on the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA). The project includes support for fundamental arithmetic and logical operations, as well as load and store instructions.Utilized forwarding and bypassing techniques to efficiently resolve data hazards

## Instruction Set
The core supports the following RISC-V instructions:
- **Arithmetic Operations**: `add`, `sub`
- **Logical Operations**: `and`, `or`
- **Other Instructions**: `load`, `store`

The instruction formatting follows the standard RISC-V conventions. For more details on the RISC-V instruction set and its formatting, please refer to the [RISC-V official documentation](https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/).
