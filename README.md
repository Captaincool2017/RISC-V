# RISC-V Project

## Overview

This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing various aspects of the RISC-V (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) architecture. RISC-V is an open-source hardware instruction set architecture (ISA) that is rapidly gaining traction in the fields of computing and embedded systems.
The goal of this project is to provide a deeper understanding of the RISC-V architecture by offering examples, tools, and guides that can be used for learning, testing, and development. Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or a professional, this repository serves as a resource to kickstart your journey with RISC-V.

## Instruction Set
The core supports the following RISC-V instructions:
- **Arithmetic Operations**: `add`, `sub`
- **Logical Operations**: `and`, `or`
- **Other Instructions**: `load`, `store`

## Features

* **Assembly Programming**: Examples of RISC-V assembly language code to demonstrate the basic functionalities and structure.
* **Simulation Environment**: Guides and tools to set up a RISC-V simulation environment using popular tools like Vivado.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
